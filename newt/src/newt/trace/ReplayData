#Write output to be traced one per line (no blank lines allowed - although fix is simple if you need to inser blank lines)
#Comment lines preceeded by #
#Sample output:
#0!146642!13!hdfs://compute-2-9.local:9977/user/sde/brinduout!part-r-00000
#0!146655!11!hdfs://compute-2-9.local:9977/user/sde/brinduout!part-r-00000

#To get output, follow these steps:
#1. Log into MYSQL on Newt master
#2. Query Newt.actorInstances table to get information about registered actors
#3. Check ActorUrl and ActorTable for actor you're interested in
#4. Log into MYSQL on the node where the actor's table is located
#5. Query the table and take random outputs
#6. It is also possible to directly write query results into a file (I think you would need to specify a file in /tmp for this)
#
#Example:
#
#ssh c3-7 (Newt master)
#mysql -u root
#select ActorTable, ActorUrl from Newt.actorInstances where ActorType = 'RW'; (if interested only in RecordWriters, semicolon is MUST)
#exit
#
#ssh c3-8 (Assuming ActorUrl before was c3-8)
#mysql -u root
#select Output from Newt.RWID_table; (Assuming this is the table of the actor)
#select Output into outfile '/tmp/outfile' fields terminated by '\t' lines terminated by '\n' from Newt.RWID_table;
#exit
#
#If selecting into outfile, use /tmp/outfile instead of this file as second input to trace client
